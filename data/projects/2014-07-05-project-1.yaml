description: No other stone has had as much as dark tales as the hope diamond. Legend has it that the 112 Karats sapphire blue diamond originally served as the eye of a statue of the Hindu goddess Sita. It was stolen by a high Brahmin. His crime so angered the goddess that she laid a curse upon the diamond. Unhappiness would follow all who dared to possess the stone. <p>In 1642 the stone mysteriously found its way into the possession of Jean-Baptist Travernier. He brought it from India to Europe, where it was fashioned into a heart shape. Travernier sold the diamond which was now only 67 Karats to a man named Toquet and then returned to India where he was eaten by wild beasts. Toquet died wretchedly in the Bastille. <p> The stone next passed to King Louis XIV. it is said that he only worn it once and soon died of the pox. Louis XV apparently never touched the stone. Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette could not resist his allure. They were both beheaded on the guillotine. <p> During the French revolution the stone was stolen from the royal treasury and disappeared until 1830 when it turned up at a London dealer. By that time the diamond had be whittled down further to 44 Karats, the weight it has today. The Hopes, a British banking family, where the only ones who escaped the full force of the curse. The wife of the second Lord Hope ran off with another man and even though the cuckolded sold the stone, both he and his wife died in poverty. <p>After that a Russian Duke owned the diamond and gave it to his lover, a dancer with the Folies-Bergeres. Jealousy drove him to shoot her and then he was murdered. Since 1958 the Hope diamond has been housed as the Smithsonian institute in Washington DC.
